The test cases run against a MSSQL Server 2000 database by default, but due to 
NHibernate's features, you can change the database to whatever you like. 


1. Modify the Connection properties information:

    The basic NHibernate settings can be set as NAnt arguments. See the "How to build.txt"
    file in the root of the repository for details.

    See file Castle.ActiveRecord.Tests\Castle.ActiveRecord.Tests.dll.config for full config.

2. Create the database

  The Test cases will generate all the necessary schema.
